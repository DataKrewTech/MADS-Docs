_Wikipedia_ defines the Internet of Things (IoT) as the network of physical objects — “things” — that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the Internet.

At Team MADS, we follow a simpler definition.

```
Internet of Things = Interconnected assets to benefit humans
```

_Wikipedia_ defines the Internet of Things (IoT) as the network of physical objects — “things” — that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the Internet.

At Team MADS, we follow a simpler definition.

```markdown
Internet of Things = Interconnected assets to benefit humans
```

There were over 30 billion active IoT devices globally in 2020, and by 2025 this number is expected to grow ~2.5x and hit to over 75 billion. By 2025, the total adressable market of IoT will grow over a trillion dollars, making it _the most valued_ disruptive technology.
